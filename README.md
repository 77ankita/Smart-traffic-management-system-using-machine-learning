# Smart-traffic-management-system-using-machine-learning
This project tries to introduce a new method for traffic Estimation based on vehicle density, which is found to be very efficient method. 
The use of YOLOalgorithm proved to be effective in accurately and quickly identifying and tracking vehicles and the AlexNet could successfully identify the features of the video inclusive of the type, color and size of the vehicles present in the video. Automatically detects and prioritizes emergency vehicles, reducing their travel time.

Algorithm used-YOLO algorithm and Alexnet CNN architecture.
